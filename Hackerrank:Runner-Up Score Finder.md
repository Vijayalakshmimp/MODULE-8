# 🏆 Hackerrank:Python Program to Calculate Total and Percentage of Marks

## 🎯 AIM:
To write a Python program that reads the marks of three subjects from the user, calculates the total marks, and computes the percentage for a student.

---

## 🧠 ALGORITHM:
1. Start the program.
2. Read three integer inputs from the user representing marks of three subjects.
3. Calculate the total marks by adding the three subject marks.
4. Compute the percentage 
5. Display the total marks and percentage obtained by the student.
6. End the program.

---

## 💻 PROGRAM:
m1,m2,m3=int(input()),int(input()),int(input())

total=m1+m2+m3;

percentage=(total/300)*100

print("Total marks obtained is {} and the percentage obtained is {}".format(total,percentage))
