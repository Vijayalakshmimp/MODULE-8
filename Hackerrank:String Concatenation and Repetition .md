# ðŸŽ“ Hackerrank:String Concatenation and Repetition in Python

This program reads the string inputs from the user, then prints their concatenation and also prints the first string repeated three times.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that reads two strings and prints:
  - The concatenation of the two strings.
  - The repetition of the first string three times.

---


## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Read the first string and store it in variable a.
3. Read the second string and store it in variable b.
4. Concatenate the two strings (a + b) and print the result.
5. Repeat the first string (a * 3) and print the result.
6. End the program.

## ðŸ’»  Program
~~~
a,b=input(),input()
print(a+b)
print(a*3)
